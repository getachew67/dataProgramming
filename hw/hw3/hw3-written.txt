1. a) Yes, because overall, it shows the percentage of all types of sex, and by seeing the plot, we can say the total percentages of people with a minimum education of high school degrees in 2009 are similar among all types of sex.
   b) I choose catplot because we can see the both the percentage of Hispanic for high school and bachelor's degree by representing them with differnt color of dots.
   And also we can see how the percent of Hispanic change among years for both min degrees.

2. There are many NaN values. For the Min degree, we cannot see the people with min degree of middle school or doctor's degree and etc.

3. The length of the dataset is 214 which is quite small, so it's hard to tell the furture prediction depending on this small dataset.
